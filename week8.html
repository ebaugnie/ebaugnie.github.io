		<h2>IL task 1 - analyse the use of audio on the web</h2>
		<p>The website closest to my subject, <a href="https://www.lettoysbetoys.org.uk/why-it-matters/">Let toys be toys,</a> doesn't use audio, so I can't use it for my analysis. So I analysed one of the websites listed on <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/websites/sound-audio/">Awwwards website : </a>  My attention was drawn to the website created by <a href="https://ryanstrzok.com">Ryan Strzok </a> </p>

		<p>The website uses background music for atmosphere. I liked the fact that you could change the radio to choose the style of music. However, I don't think this adds much to the website. I would have found it interesting if the sound had changed automatically according to the mood of the digital campaigns created by the author. </p>
		<p>As I wasn't satisfied with the results of the first website, I decided to analyse another website created by <a href="https://haunted.thedigitalpanda.com">The Digital Panda</a>. </p>

		<p> I really liked the background music, which really added to the site. It's a horror universe and we have to link the objects in the house with the horror films in which they appeared. The background music is similar to horror music, which creates a special, more gripping atmosphere. 
		What's more, as you navigate through the house, there are sound effects such as evil laughter, creaking doors and creaking stairs. These sound effects also add a real plus to the navigation and atmosphere. </p>
