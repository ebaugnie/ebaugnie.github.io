		<h1>Week 1 tasks</h1>
		
		<section id="task1">
		<h2>Task 1 : choosing my topic</h2>
		<p>These are my ideas of subject : </p>  
				<li>How to begin to be a runner</li>
				<li>Zodiac sign</li>
				<li>How to have the perfect morning routine</li>
				<li>Femvertising</li>
		<p> Finally, I choose femvertising because it's my thesis subject in my home university. But I wanted to look at it from a different angle. This is the reason why I took the question : "is this advertising sexist or feminist ?"</p>
		<p>After my feedback, I was asked to refine my subject as feminist advertising can be vague. So I decided to focus on children's toy advertising. The clichés of sexist toy shops persist and highlighting how to recognise feminist advertising could help parents to eradicate sexism from childhood.</p>
		<li>Final topic : feminism in toy advertising</li>
		<p> A campaign highlights the problem of gendered toys and the importance of creating inclusive toys. The name of the campaign is <a href="https://www.lettoysbetoys.org.uk"> Let toys be toys </a> </p>

		<h2>Task 2 : Explore the scope of the topic and narrow down the focus</h2>
		<p>The main question is : "is this advert feminist ?" In fact, I'm going to ask people to find out whether they can recognise a feminist ad or not.</p>
		<p>Some people tought that femvertising is a recent phenomenon. But it's not the case even if "femvertising" is a recent term. It's why, I'll use advertising from differents period. To find the good sources, there are the boolean operators I used : Feminism AND advertising, Feminist AND advertising, femwashing, fake AND femvertising, vintage AND female AND advertising, vintage AND feministe AND advertsing.
		Finally there are some sources who look important for me.</p>
		<ul>
				<li>The book frome Andi Zeisler, "We were feminist once" is one of the best book if we wantt to learn about women representation and how to be feminist.</li>
				<li>Pinterest collections contain a large number of vintage advertisements</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.fauxfeminism.com"> Faux feminism</a> This website hightlight the good and bad campaign feminists. Moreover, Katie Martell create the Litmus test to recognize if the brand make femwashing or not.</li>
				<li>This article gives some tools to make but also to recognize advertising<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjQ3YnT_O2BAxVNXUEAHcHkBewQFnoECA0QAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.atlantis-press.com%2Farticle%2F125992183.pdf&usg=AOvVaw27hql0NiC9sCL1BR99JJqs&opi=89978449"> (scientific article) </a> </li>
		</ul>
		<p>I also looked for sources that focused solely on children's toy advertising and its repercussions. I always tried to find documents related to feminism and gender.</p>
		<ul>
				<li>Dinella, Lisa, "Gender-Typing of Children’s Toys: Causes, Consequences, and Correlates" in Sex roles, v 79 no. 5-6, pp 253-259, 2018-09-01</li>
				<li>Fern Johnson & Karren Young (2002) Gendered voices in children's television advertising, Critical Studies in Media Communication, 19:4, 461-480, DOI: 10.1080/07393180216572</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I'm going to use the sources in my explanations and definitions of feminist and non-feminist advertising. I can't afford to give a subjective opinion on this kind of subject. The sources will allow me to analyse the qualities of a feminist ad but also to explain to visitors why it's important to give them interest.</p>

		<h2>Task 3 : Keeping track of my resources</h2>
		<p> I created a folder in my computer to keep the all document</p> 
		<img src="images/screen/bibli.png" alt="documents" height="150">
		<p>In this folder is a Word document containing my entire bibliography. You can also find this document below.</p>

		<h2>Lab Task 1 - Setting up my file structure</h2>
		<p> Here is the location of the file. As stated in the instructions, organisation is important. Even more so when working for HTML.</p>

		<h2>Lab Task 2 - Review of HTML</h2>
		<p>I'm not very confident with coding. I've used it in the past, but only with Python, to do a Twitter analysis study. So this will be the first time I've created a website. 
		So I'm very happy to have the template that I'm using as a basis for building my portfolio.</p>
