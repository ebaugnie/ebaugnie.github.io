		<h2>Task 1</h2>
		<p>These are my ideas of subject : </p>  
				<li>How to begin to be a runner</li>
				<li>Zodiac sign</li>
				<li>How to have the perfect morning routine</li>
				<li>Femvertising</li>
		<p> Finally, I choose femvertising because it's my thesis subject in my home university. But I wanted to look at it from a different angle. This is the reason why I took the question : "is this advertising sexist or feminist ?"</p>

		<section id="task2">
		<h2>Some links and bibliography</h2>
		<p>Some people tought that femvertising is a recent phenomenon. But it's not the case even if "femvertising" is a recent term. It's why, I'll use advertising from differents period. To find the good sources, there are the boolean operators I used : Feminism AND advertising, Feminist AND advertising, femwashing, fake AND femvertising, vintage AND female AND advertising, vintage AND feministe AND advertsing.
		Finally there are some sources who look important for me</p>
		<ul>
				<li>The book frome Andi Zeisler, "We were feminist once" is one of the best book if we wantt to learn about women representation and how to be feminist.</li>
				<li>Pinterest collections contain a large number of vintage advertisements</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.fauxfeminism.com"> Faux feminism</a> This website hightlight the good and bad campaign feminists. Moreover, Katie Martell create the Litmus test to recognize if the brand make femwashing or not.</li>
				<li>This article gives some tools to make but also to recognize advertising<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjQ3YnT_O2BAxVNXUEAHcHkBewQFnoECA0QAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.atlantis-press.com%2Farticle%2F125992183.pdf&usg=AOvVaw27hql0NiC9sCL1BR99JJqs&opi=89978449"> (scientific article) </a> </li>
