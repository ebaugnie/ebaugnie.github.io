		<h2>Is this toy advertising sexist or feminist ?</h2>
		<p>For some time now, we've been hearing about femvertising, the use of feminist values in marketing and advertising. In the scientific literature, one area seems to be forgotten: marketing to children. That's why the aim of this site is to help you recognise sexist or feminist advertising, and therefore inclusive advertising for children's toys.</p>
