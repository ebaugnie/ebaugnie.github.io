		<h1>Week 3</h1>
		<h2>IL task 1 : Identify key narrative points and create a plan</h2>
		<p> Like I explainded for the week 2, I wanna create an interactive way to discover the subject. The aim is to create self-reflection and self-assessment of the ability to recognise sexist or non-sexist advertising. What's more, this gaming aspect will capture the user's attention, so they may stay longer than on a simple blog. Of course, it would be important to create an additional page to the game, highlighting the impact of toy advertising on children. </p>

<h2> IL task 2 : Incorporate the narrative plan into your portfolio </h2>
<p>The overall story will therefore be one of questioning the consumer's ability to recognise what is sexist and what is not. </p>
<h2> Lab Task : Git Hub</h2> 
		<p>It was my first time creating a GitHub project. The interface is a bit complicated to understand the first time but fortunately I followed the laboratory. 
		I would still need to be careful to upload all the documents and not just one as I did for the first change.
		As the project progressed, I found it easier and I understood the HTML code better, which gave me more confidence for the rest of the project.</p>

		<p> My repository name is : "ebaugnie.github.io". So I uploaded all my documents to the git hub so that they would appear as a site. <a href="https://ebaugnie.github.io"> Git Hub link</a></p>
