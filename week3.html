		<h1>Week 3</h1>
		<p>It was my first time creating a GitHub project. The interface is a bit complicated to understand the first time but fortunately I followed the laboratory. 
		I would still need to be careful to upload all the documents and not just one as I did for the first change.
		As the project progressed, I found it easier and I understood the HTML code better, which gave me more confidence for the rest of the project.</p>
