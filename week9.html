		<h2>IL task 1 - Analyse the use of video on the web</h2>
		<p>For my review, I analysed one of the websites listed on <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/websites/video/">Awwwards website </a> : <a href="https://www.arraisballet.com">Arras ballet,</a> created by Zeitler Design. </p>
	<video width='320' height="180" controls>
	<source src="video/ballet.mov" type="video/mp4">
	</video>
		<p> As you can see, the website used a lot of videos. I really liked the way the video embedding started automatically. They seem to be used here to give more rhythm to the website but also to highlight the product on offer: classical dance lessons. Another advantage is that videos do not detract from the quality of the website.</p>
		<h2>IL task 2 - Generate a portfolio of video content</h2>
		<p> For my website, I need to use video to show some advertising. As there aren't enough ads in image format, I feel it's important to use the different types of documents available to me, including videos. I found 2 websites with a lot of video about my subject : children advertisings</p>
		<li> <a href="https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/the-work/sector/media-entertainment-brands/toy-brands/5861">Campaign live </a> </li>
		<li><a href="https://www.adsoftheworld.com/industries/toys">Ads of the world </a> </li>
		<p> For this types of videos, I need to be careful about the copyright policy. </p>
		<p> I also think that using a video of children who play or a video who illustrate toys on my home page and my explication page can give my site more dynamism. If I use video to hilight my subject and create more dynamism, I also need to be careful to use video who looks inclusive and not sexist. The aim is to use its videos to showcase ideas of inclusivity and genderless education.</p>
<p> I used the websites cited in the Moodle and make this following researchs : "Children playing" and I founded 2 videos : </p>
<li> The firsrt one in <a href="https://pixabay.com/fr/">Pixabay</a> </li>
	<video width='320' height="180" controls>
	<source src="video/carousel.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<li> The other one in <a href="https://www.pexels.com/fr-fr/">Pexels</a> </li>
	<video width='320' height="180" controls>
	<source src="video/childplaying.mp4" type="video/mp4">

		<h2>Lab activity - Editing digital video</h2>
		<p> I used the software provided in the moodle to edit my videos. It was a bit confusing because I'm used to doing video editing with the lumafusion application, but the interface remains quite similar and intuitive. </p>
		<p> Here is the video in low quality without the modifications. I coupled 2 other videos found on the site <a href="https://www.pexels.com/fr-fr/">Pexels.</a> </p>
<video width='320' height="180" controls>
	<source src="video/old.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<img src="images/screen/video1.jpeg" alt="Analyse" height="200">
<p>Here is the video in the 3 qualities requested. I increased the speed 2 times on the first and 4 times on the second. I also added a transition between the 2 videos.</p>
